**RAG System for PDF Data Querying and Vector Embeddings**

**Overview**
This repository contains a system for extracting information from PDF files and generating vector embeddings. The system leverages OpenAI and Llama-index to achieve this functionality. This code will be helpful to query the details from local vector DB.

**Features**
1. **PDF Data Extraction:** The system can extract relevant data from PDF files, allowing you to query specific information.
2. **Vector Embeddings:** It generates vector representations (embeddings) for the extracted data, which can be useful for downstream tasks like similarity analysis or clustering.
3. **Local Storage:** The vector embeddings are stored locally for easy access and further analysis.
   
**Getting Started**
**Installation:**
!!! Make sure you have Python installed (preferably **Python 3.11**+).
